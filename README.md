# VeganCaju

VeganCaju is an online store for a vegan truffles store. The main goal of the company is to provice a harmless and tasty solution to vegans and for those who are trying to adopt this philosophy. The target users are between 17-40 years old, which is the average age of more than 50% of vegans. The website consists of an application that allows user to choose between different box sizes and truffles flavors, and a pick-up date (since the company yet does not provide delivery), after an account was created. After the order was created on the ORDER page, users chan check and modify orders that are not yet approved on MY ORDERS page.
